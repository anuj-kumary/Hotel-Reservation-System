# Conclusion :

The Online Hotel Reservation System was developed to replace the
manual process of booking for a hotel room or any other facility of the
hotel. The old system does not serve the customer in a better way;
rather it makes customer data vulnerable. The new system keeps proper
records of customers for emergency and security purposes. The hotel’s
advertising effort is now accompanied by a virtual tour created on the
system.
